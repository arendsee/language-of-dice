Language of Dice
================

## Goals

 * complex events can be built up from simple events

 * can succinctly express concepts such as advantage and disadvantage

 * can easily get the expected outcomes

 * can easily get the distribution of a complex event

 * calculations of distributions and expectations as abstracted away from the
   user (the are in the purview of the interpreter)

## Examples

```
# executing this will return a single result
dc    = 15          # assign a constant value
dmg  := 1d6 + 3     # assign to a random variable (each usage rolls a die)
crit := dmg + dmg   # assign to an event
1d20
    (. == 20) crit  # the '.' carries the value of the initial event
    (. >  dc) dmg
# every event yields 0 by default
```


```
dmg  := 1d6 + 3
crit := dmg + dmg
hp = 100
turns = 0
while hp > 0
    turns += 1 
    1d20
        (. == 20) {hp -= crit}
        (. > dc)  {hp -= dmg}
done
# yield is necessary when the value returned by the last event is not the value of interest
yield turns

# executing this will return the string below, where *mean* and *sd* are
# keywords representing the mean and standard deviation of the root event 
'mean: {} sd: {}' mean sd
```
